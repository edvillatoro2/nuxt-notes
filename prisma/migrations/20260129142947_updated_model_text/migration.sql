/*
  Warnings:

  - The primary key for the `Note` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `Note` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The primary key for the `User` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `User` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - Changed the type of `userId` on the `Note` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
